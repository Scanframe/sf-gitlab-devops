## Images

### LibreOffice

The image below is created using LibreOffice (file: `svg-images.odg`) since it is the
only cross-platform application able to export SVG well enough.<br>
To get a file like this select all items in the page wit `Ctrl+A` then export the file
with menu `File | Export` and in the save dialog put a checkmark at **Selection** option.
When not, the whole page is put in the resulting SVG-file which means a lot of white space around it.

![services-processes](./services-processes.svg "Services & processes")

### PlantUML

This next SVG image is generated by PlantUML using Doxygen's PlantUML plugin.
Jar-file is automatically fetched and/or downloaded.

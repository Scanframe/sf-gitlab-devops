## Markdown Pages

This current page is the main page of the generate HTML pages.
It is a mandatory file in this Doxygen setup.

Open the [README](../../README.md) page of this project.
_The reference is relative to the cmake_build_* directory.

## Images

This image below is created using LibreOffice (file: `svg-images.odg`) since it is the 
only cross-platform application able to export SVG well enough.<br>
To get a file like this select all items in the page wit `Ctrl+A` then export the file 
with menu `File | Export` and in the save dialog put a checkmark at **Selection** &#10004; option.
When not, the whole page is put in the resulting SVG-file which means a lot of white space around it.
